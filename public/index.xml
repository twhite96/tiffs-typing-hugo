      <description>Andrew Callaghan at Channel 5 News is many things1 but he&amp;rsquo;s still one of the best journalists, anywhere.
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }   The allegations of sexual misconduct are unforgivable and he has addressed this with honesty. It does not excuse the behavior, nor does his journalism, but I think his channel is important and ignoring it altogether does a disservice to nuanced discourse.</description>

      <description>Complex Grief is hell. It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 years since I lost my mom to dementia, my job to COVID, and my therapist who was more than that to me, more like my best friend, all within 9 months.
I am still not over any of this and I should probably seek grief counseling.
Anyway here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist.</description>

      <description>I came of age in the late nineties and early aughts and a lot of my musical tastes reflect this.
At the time Set It Off was released I&amp;rsquo;d not been heavy into hip hop for close to a decade but the SIO soundtrack changed that for me.
Da 5 Footaz went in on this track and it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorites off the soundtrack.
Namecallin&#39; Queen Latifa, for me, as a kid watching BET in the late 80s was Ladies First and in the 90s, U.</description>

      <description>Jack Olsen is a master at weaving compelling tales about the crimes of some of the most sinister, violent, and stupid people on earth.
This book was no different.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve hopped between different RSS reeders ever since I started using RSS back in 2007.
I was on Windows then and using FeedDemon1.
Eventually I discovered Google Reader and hooked it up with FeedDemon for syncing across to my Samsung Galaxy, the first smartphone I owned back in 2010.
There were so many different types of RSS readers, my favorite being gReader for Android. It was customizable and easy on the eyes.</description>

      <description>HRH Prince Charles and Sir Jony Ive on designing for a better world From DEYAN SUDJIC at Wallpaper.com -
 When Ive talks about design, his language is fiercely moralistic. ‚ÄòI am angry that most of what is made seems so thoughtless. So many products do not deserve to exist. The minimum that they should do to justify themselves and consume all that material is that their designers should care about them.</description>
