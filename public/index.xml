      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve hopped between different RSS reeders ever since I started using RSS back in 2007.
I was on Windows then and using FeedDemon1.
Eventually I discovered Google Reader and hooked it up with FeedDemon for syncing across to my Samsung Galaxy, the first smartphone I owned back in 2010.
There were so many different types of RSS readers, my favorite being gReader for Android. It was customizable and easy on the eyes.</description>

      <description>Cold Kill Review Jack Olsen is a master at weaving compelling tales about the crimes of some of the most sinister, violent, and stupid people on earth.
This book was no different.

      <description>Executive Dysfunction and Time Management What is &amp;ldquo;executive dysfunction&amp;rdquo;? For me it is a play on the term &amp;ldquo;executive function disorder&amp;rdquo; which is a new, trendy, word1 for people who suffer from lack of motivation, poor impulse control, emotional distress, and other symptoms of not having your shit together. It is not an official diagnosis, but lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about EFD and how I suffer from, and have all my life, suffered from, EFD2.</description>

      <description>GeekMadeDesigns Makes Gaming Accessories to Show Off Your Style [CARD TEXT]
I am on the move again so some of these things will look different in a few months. The house is too much for me to handle as I am still trying to get healthy after injuring my old self.
I love SpawnPoiint&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel for gaming, TV, and gaming accessory reviews.
He introduced me to GeekMadeDesigns and once I saw that it was a wrap.</description>

      <description>I am constantly fretting over how much I should be posting to all of the blogs I write for.
I have three main ones that I feel I could make a brand from1 and because I feel I need them to be a brand I feel stuck. I get overwhelmed, I don&amp;rsquo;t write, and I binge YouTube.
I read a lot of folks&#39; thoughts on how they&amp;rsquo;ve relieved the pressure of marketing themselves by not giving a shit.</description>

      <description>In My Feelings Complex Grief is hell. It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 years since I lost my mom to dementia, my job to COVID, and my therapist who was more than that to me, more like my best friend, all within 9 months.
I am still not over any of this and I should probably seek grief counseling.
Anyway here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist.</description>

      <description>Music that shaped my youth I came of age in the late nineties and early aughts and a lot of my musical tastes reflect this.
At the time Set It Off was released I&amp;rsquo;d not been heavy into hip hop for close to a decade but the SIO soundtrack changed that for me.
Da 5 Footaz went in on this track and it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorites off the soundtrack.</description>

      <description>MacSparky, one of my favorite Mac people, has gone about creating his own office space and designing it using Home Design 3D.
I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen SketchUp for my 3D modeling software and it&amp;rsquo;s great in a lot of ways but converting raster images to .skp files is next to impossible to do within SketchUp itself.
The best part, however, is that there is a marketplace for models from different well-known brands you can download for free.</description>

Beautiful.

Detailed.
IMG_2320.JPG
Interesting story.
games/IMG_2314.JPG
Wonky gameplay.
IMG_2322.JPG
Unreal graphics.
games/IMG_2313.JPG
Smooth, fluid controls, perhaps too fluid.

 MSI Nvidia GTX1650 GPU - $400 ASUS TUF CPU - $216 Corsair CX550F RGB POS - $62 Samsung EVO 970 Plus SSD - $150 Corsair Vengeance Pro 32 GB RAM - $236 Corsair Crystal Case - $140 Corsair LL Series Fan - $92 TP-Link AC1900 USB 3.</description>

      <description>HRH Prince Charles and Sir Jony Ive on designing for a better world From DEYAN SUDJIC at Wallpaper.com -
 When Ive talks about design, his language is fiercely moralistic. ‘I am angry that most of what is made seems so thoughtless. So many products do not deserve to exist. The minimum that they should do to justify themselves and consume all that material is that their designers should care about them.</description>
