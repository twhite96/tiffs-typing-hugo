      <description>If working in corporate in an industry with money flowing out of every orifice with dudes who honestly believe a website that allows you to just say &amp;lsquo;yo&amp;rsquo; to someone is worth billions of dolllars with billions of personal wealth, their companies still raking in massive revenues and profits then layoff people who are pregnant right before Christmas.

      <description>I legit can&amp;rsquo;t stay asleep. I am tired. All the time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that I am also anemic.
Please send help. And leg of lamb. And buckets of spinach.</description>

      <description>For the first time in years, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt that swell of excitement, of giddyness, that I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt in so long.
Things are going well, even after my latest trip to the Mental Prison for a pretty badly needed break from compounding stress.
I have a case manager now, and we&amp;rsquo;re working on me getting back on my feet, and for the first time in a long time I have hope.</description>

      <title>SkyCorp: The Best YouTube Channel You&#39;ve Never Heard Of</title>

      <description>SkyCorp Video is the most random recommendation I&amp;rsquo;ve ever received from YouTube.
It&amp;rsquo;s a 90s infomercial-like channel that is equal parts Kids in the Hall and Black Mirror.
I was genuinely surprised with how well these are made, how true to the time period they are, and some of which were just utterly terrifying, in a quasi Black Mirror way.
Some of my favorite skits ‚ö†Ô∏èThese are vulgar and sometimes violent skits so Viewer Discretion is Advised.</description>

      <description>Andrew Callaghan at Channel 5 News is many things1 but he&amp;rsquo;s still one of the best journalists, anywhere.
The allegations of sexual misconduct are unforgivable and he has addressed this with honesty. It does not excuse the behavior, nor does his journalism, but I think his channel is important and ignoring it altogether does a disservice to nuanced discourse.&amp;#160;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</description>

      <description>Complex Grief is hell. It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 years since I lost my mom to dementia, my job to COVID, and my therapist who was more than that to me, more like my best friend, all within 9 months.
I am still not over any of this and I should probably seek grief counseling.
Anyway here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist.</description>

      <description>üí°I am on the move again so some of these things will look different in a few months. The house is too much for me to handle as I am still trying to get healthy after injuring my old self..I love SpawnPoiint&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel for gaming, TV, and gaming accessory reviews.
He introduced me to GeekMadeDesigns and once I saw that it was a wrap.</description>

      <description>I came of age in the late nineties and early aughts and a lot of my musical tastes reflect this.
At the time Set It Off was released I&amp;rsquo;d not been heavy into hip hop for close to a decade but the SIO soundtrack changed that for me.
Da 5 Footaz went in on this track and it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorites off the soundtrack.
Namecallin&#39; Queen Latifa, for me, as a kid watching BET in the late 80s was Ladies First and in the 90s, U.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not part of MacSparky Labs give it a look.
I&amp;rsquo;ve subscribed and his videos on iOS 16 Focus Modes and the iPad as a Status Board videos1 are worth the price alone2.
Unlisted so I won&amp;rsquo;t list them here.&amp;#160;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve hopped between different RSS reeders ever since I started using RSS back in 2007.
I was on Windows then and using FeedDemon1.
Eventually I discovered Google Reader and hooked it up with FeedDemon for syncing across to my Samsung Galaxy, the first smartphone I owned back in 2010.
There were so many different types of RSS readers, my favorite being gReader for Android. It was customizable and easy on the eyes.</description>

      <description>HRH Prince Charles and Sir Jony Ive on designing for a better world From DEYAN SUDJIC at Wallpaper.com -
When Ive talks about design, his language is fiercely moralistic. ‚ÄòI am angry that most of what is made seems so thoughtless. So many products do not deserve to exist. The minimum that they should do to justify themselves and consume all that material is that their designers should care about them.</description>
