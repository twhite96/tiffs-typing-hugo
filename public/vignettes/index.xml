      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve shared his videos in another post and when I moved into my home1 his place was a major inspiration to the aesthetic I was after there.
A lot of stuff he recommended I purchased and my favorite, besides the GeekMadeDesigns stuff2 is his shelf full of gaming consoles and accessories.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find his exact shelf as he is in the UK, but I found one similar at Wayfair and purchased it.</description>
