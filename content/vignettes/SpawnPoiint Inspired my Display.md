I've shared his videos [in another post](/posts/geekmadedesigns-makes-gaming-accessory-items-to-show-off-your-style/) and when I moved into my home[^1] his place was a major inspiration to the aesthetic I was after there.

A lot of stuff he recommended I purchased and my favorite, besides the GeekMadeDesigns stuff[^2] is his shelf full of gaming consoles and accessories.

I couldn't find his exact shelf as he is in the UK, but I found one similar at Wayfair and purchased it.

After many iterations, this is what I've got. Should have bought the disassembled game controller or something instead of the iPhone. Oh well.
