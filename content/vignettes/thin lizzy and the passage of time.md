My best friend from high school which  I found on LinkedIn. You may remember that whole history, but I was hopping around the internet and found her. I opened her pic in a new tab and looked at her now 44 year old face. It is rounder, fuller. Her hairline is a receding a bit. I am pretty sure, considering what she was as a teenager, a lesbian, which there’s nothing wrong with that, and in fact I am happy she’s happy with that. The most important thing that happened for me tonight while looking at her face was an immense sense of closure. Like. All this time in my head she was 15, she had not changed. Every dream I dreamt of her was of her at 12-16, and me at my current ages, whatever they were. Seeing that time has gone on and she isn’t that girl, I am not that girl, has allowed me some much needed peace after almost 30 years.

No, I am not going to contact her or anything like that. No need to because I know that we are completely different women from the girls we wereThat the friendship was not a healthy one. 

And I am content at where I am in life.
