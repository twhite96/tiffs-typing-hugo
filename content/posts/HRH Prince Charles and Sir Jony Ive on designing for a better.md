# HRH Prince Charles and Sir Jony Ive on designing for a better world

From *DEYAN SUDJIC* at Wallpaper.com - 

> When Ive talks about design, his language is fiercely moralistic. â€˜I am angry that most of what is made seems so thoughtless. So many products do not deserve to exist. The minimum that they should do to justify themselves and consume all that material is that their designers should care about them.

Who gets to say what kind of designs should and shouldn't exist? These are *products* not *spiritual* things.

Jony is a generational design talent but sometimes it's hard to get past a guy sniffing his own farts.
