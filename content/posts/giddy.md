For the first time in years, I've felt that swell of excitement, of giddyness, that I haven't felt in so long.

Things are going well, even after my latest trip to the Mental Prison for a pretty badly needed break from compounding stress.

I have a case manager now, and we're working on me getting back on my feet, and for the first time in a long time I have *hope*.

## Taking control

I have all these Safari PWAs open on my Mac and projects all around me and it feels... *so*. *damn*. *good*. I don't know how to explain it.

Because just a few minutes ago I was ready to pull my veins from my skin.

Brains. Weird little things, them.
