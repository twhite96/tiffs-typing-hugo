I am constantly fretting over how much I should be posting to *all* of the blogs I write for.

I have three main ones that I feel I could make a brand from[^1] and because I feel I need them to be a *brand* I feel stuck. I get overwhelmed, I don't write, and I binge YouTube.

I read a lot of folks' thoughts on how they've relieved the pressure of marketing themselves by not giving a shit.





[^1]: Yeah I know it sounds icky but that's exactly what it is.
