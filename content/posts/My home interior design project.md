MacSparky, one of my favorite Mac people, [has gone about creating his own office space](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2022/07/endor-studios-construction-update-macsparky-labs/) and designing it using [Home Design 3D](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-design-3d/id1342163391?mt=12&uo=4). 

I've chosen SketchUp for my 3D modeling software and it's great in a lot of ways but converting raster images to `.skp` files is next to impossible to do within SketchUp itself.

The best part, however, is that there is a marketplace for models from different well-known brands you can download *for free*.


## A look at a model

Here is a mockup of the entertainment center for my home theater room upstairs, which is almost like the items I have upstairs in that room[^1].

[^1]: Except for the drawers. I have two white drawers in the console, not four. Not sure how to configure those yet.
