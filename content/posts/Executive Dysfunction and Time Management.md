# Executive Dysfunction and Time Management

What is "executive dysfunction"? For me it is a play on the term "[executive function disorder](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/executive-function)" which is a new, trendy, word[^1] for people who suffer from lack of motivation, poor impulse control, emotional distress, and other symptoms of not having your shit together. It is not an official diagnosis, but lately I've been thinking about EFD and how I suffer from, and have all my life, suffered from, EFD[^2].

But this specific post is about how I'm finding it difficult to remember what I need to do, juggling multiple projects, managing my time, and getting shit done accordingly.

## How did I get here?

There are a few reasons for this which I don't want to get into here; I pay good money for a therapist to suss these things out, no need to write about them here.

But there _is_ something that's helped further the dysfunction along: the abundance of all the world's knowledge, art, and entertainment, everywhere, notifications rolling across all my screens like a stock market ticker tape[^3].

I've tried tons of things in the past to get organized, even a Franklin Covey Planner of all things.

[^1]: Symptom?
[^2]: These symptoms overlap with certain personality disorders which I find interesting.
[^3]: Not really. I have important notifications come in and nothing else.
